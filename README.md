# Bov Controll Challenge

In this challenge, I basically implemented a CRUD of checklists, but with a difference: users can use the application offline, saving data locally with RealmDB.

The code didn't turn out as nicely as I wanted due to the time, but it's worth doing some refactoring in the future.
